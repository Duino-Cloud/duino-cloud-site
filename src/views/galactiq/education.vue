            <strong>Galactiq is happy to announce our Education program! This program is for public/private schooling.</strong>
          </p>
  
          <h3>
            <strong>Why?</strong>
          </h3>
          <p>
            Galactiq is run by current and former students moved by teamwork and programming. We want students to be able to have the opportunity to carve out their own path
            in the tech space. Minecraft is great for team building and a good entry into the world of programming. Minecraft can help with researching skills, experimentation and helps
            students get creative.
          </p>
  
          <h3>
            <strong>Teamwork</strong>
          </h3>
          <p>
            With our Education program you can be provided a game server for your students to join! 
          </p>
          <p>
            We recommend giving them an assignment, have them create the server themselves from the ground up. Have them research the software, test, experiment, build, ect. 
            Creating a Minecraft server is an amazing team building exercise, let them work together and figure out the best tools and methods to finish the project.
          </p>
  
          <h3>
            <strong>Fun!</strong>
          </h3>
          <p>
            This program allows students to enjoy their projects, they get to have fun and enjoy working together and teachers get to have fun with coming up with project ideas!
          </p>
  
          <h3>
