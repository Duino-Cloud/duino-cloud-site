            Dedicated Physical Backup
          </h3>
          <p>
            Dedicated Physical Backups give users their own hard drive specifically for backing up their data. 
            Whenever a customer requests a cold backup, we'll backup their data to their hard drive and keep it unplugged and safe
            from any harsh enviroments. This service keeps customer data safe from accidental deletion.

            By default, these backup drives will range anywhere from 320GB-500GB and will be selected randomly. If your server uses a higher than normal
            amount of storage we'll select a larger disk than normal automatically.
