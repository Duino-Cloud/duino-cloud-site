                The DucoCloud marketplace is a PRIVILEGE. If you wish to use the marketplace then you must follow rules documented here. If you find a loophole and you use it you risk having your
                account banned from both DucoCloud and it's services/servers

              <strong>DucoCloud Escrow</strong>
            </h3>
            <p>
                The DucoCloud marketplace aims to enforce BOTH sides of purchases. When someone contacts you about a listing you must reference them to the official DucoCloud Escrow account.
                The DucoCloud Escrow account (Descrow for short) is a very important process when handling marketplace transactions. Descrow allows us to temporarily hold funds that are intended
                for a marketplace listing owner until they have fulfilled their end of the arrangement with the customer. Attempting to go around this process will result in the responsible parties ban
                from the DucoCloud network and all services. 
            </p>
            <p>
                All Marketplace sellers will be granted a random seller ID. The ID is required to be in the transaction memo when the customer is sending to the Escrow account. If no seller ID is specified
                (or an invalid ID) the payment will be kicked back to the customer. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A bounty of á•²100 will be granted to those who report someone circumventing Descrow (As long as the ban is processed with enough evidence)
            </p>
            <h3>
              <strong>Marketplace TrustPilot</strong>
            </h3>
            <p>
                We recommend creating a TrustPilot account when adding a marketplace listing. We allow for integration for your TrustPilot account to show up on the marketplace listing.
            </p>
            <h3>
              <strong>Content Delivery</strong>
            </h3>
            <p>
                Sellers can opt to leave contact information out of the listing and instead opt for us to notify the seller when a customer has sent a payment into Descrow.
                (This option may lead to increased content/service delivery times. We generally recommend sellers allow for direct contact.)
