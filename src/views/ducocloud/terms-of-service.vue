        </h3>
        <p>
          If any data from nodes, configurations or anything that goes through
          tickets and support is leaked by a staff member the client has the
          right to a full refund and the staff member will be fired under
          circumstances. If any client owned files are leaked by a server /

          We do not offer refunds unless an Executive says otherwise. This means
          that all transactions are final and may not be refunded. If an
          Executive says a refund should be done the payment will be done the
          same way it was sent to Galactiq. If there were transactions charges
          these will apply again.

        <h3>
          Extra Services
        </h3>
        <p>
          In the case that you need help with your server, for example, setting
          up a plugin on your Minecraft server, extra charges may apply. If the
          question is simple, for example, "Where can I find the configuration
          of plugin X", no extra charges will be applied. In the case that a
          staff member needs to do research and do more advanced tasks, for
          example, making a custom configuration file, extra charges will be
          applied. The base price is €0,25 and then €0,10 for every 10 minutes.

          best to mitigate it. You will receive an email afterwards asking for a
          statement and if you know who executed the attack. If your server

        <h3>
          Fair use
        </h3>
        <p>
          All Galactiq services and products come with unlimited bandwidth and cpu usage. But if
          your service and/or product uses a lot of resources for a prolonged
          period of time we will start an investigation. If the outcome of said
          investigation concludes you break our Terms of Service we have the
          right to permanently terminate your product and or service with an upfront
          notice.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are using an aggressive amount of CPU for an extended period of time, we may throttle your server temporarily until it has stopped.
          We will send you an email letting you know that we have throttled your server. If you continue to use too much CPU resources for an extended amount of time,
          you may have your service suspended pending further investigation. If you need a large amount of CPU resources you may contact us in advance so we can
          accommodate for your situation.
