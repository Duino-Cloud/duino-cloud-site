                Folia stands to change the game when it comes to running a public Minecraft server, it's massive performance improvements and fascinating changes unlock a variety of hardware eligible for running servers.
              </p>
              <h3>
                <strong>How big is the improvement in performance?</strong>
              </h3>
              <p>
                From our very limited testing all we can say is that the performance is amazing, some of the best we've ever seen on any hardware. Hardware that we had deemed too old or slow to be used as nodes have suddenly
                become viable for running servers using Folia!
              </p>
              <h3>
                <strong>When can I use it?</strong>
              </h3>
              <p>
                Currently Folia is NOT ready for Production, so we will not be providing early builds. You are perfectly allowed to compile it yourself, however we do not support running Folia at this time.
                You will most definitely run into issues if you choose to compile Folia and run it. As of right now Folia will only be supported on Dedicated Systems as you need at least 16 cores for Folia to run well.
              </p>
              <h3>
                <strong>Implementation into DEN's</strong>
              </h3>
              <p>
                Once Folia is ready, we'll allow it to be installed to DEN's during the purchase process. You'll be able to install it to any DEN during purchase but we will not have the installation option
                available for normal servers. Running Folia on servers less than 16 cores yields less than desirable results.
