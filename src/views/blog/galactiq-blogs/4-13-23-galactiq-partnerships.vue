                <strong>Requirements</strong>
              </h3>
              <p>
                We love working with all types of creators both small and large. We don't have any set requirements, instead we take a look at your channel and content and go from there!
                (If we've reached out to you then we've most likely already decided)
              </p>
              <p>
                At Galactiq we have 2 different levels of affiliate. 
              </p>
              <h3>
                <strong>Standard Affiliate</strong>
              </h3>
              <p>
                By default, ALL Galactiq customers are Affiliates. Every user gets a unique affiliate code they can use, when they invite someone and that person spends money, the owner of the used code
                gets 10% of their total purchase added to their credit balance to go towards any of their services.
              </p>
              <h3>
                <strong>Partners</strong>
              </h3>
              <p>
                Partners start off at 15% and get an affiliate code, however instead of their earnings going toward services it sits as a balance which gets paid at the end of the month. Partners get their 15% every time
                someone who used their code adds more credit, they do not have to use the affiliate code again. 
              </p>
              <h3>
                <strong>You are Valued</strong>
              </h3>
              <p>
                Regardless if you are just a customer using your affiliate code or a partner, we want to work with you and we will acknowledge your existence. Our affiliate program is important to us because not only does it
                compensate you for driving traffic to us, but it helps us build a strong relationship with you.
              </p>
              <h3>
                <strong>Discounts</strong>
              </h3>
              <p>
                We grant all partners 50% off on all Galactiq services!
              </p>
