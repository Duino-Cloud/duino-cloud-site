                The Beginning of Galactiq
              </p>
              <h3>
                <strong>The Reason</strong>
              </h3>
              <p>
                In 2021, Max was a Minecraft server owner constantly working on his community. He had run into several issues with different hosts and it became tiresome.
                Shortly after he decided that he should start his own server hosting company so that he could try and make not only his experience better, but everyone elses. This was the beginning of CrewCraft.
              </p>
            
              <h3>
                <strong>First Steps</strong>
              </h3>
              <p>
                After aquiring hardware, Max opened a store online and began selling Minecraft servers. However at this time he was processing orders by hand with absolutely no automation.
                This deterred people from using CrewCraft as the wait times were often a day or more. Max needed a new approach fast before CrewCraft failed completely.
              </p>
              <h3>
                <strong>Diskos</strong>
              </h3>
              <p>
                Max had met a customer looking at his services after leaving a host named Diskos, of course Max was happy to bring on a new customer. This customer turned out to be a lot more than Max originally thought,
                in fact this customer turned out to be scamming people in order to keep their server afloat. Max reached out to the previous host who confirmed that it was the very reason the customer had left. This conversation
                led to a work relationship stringing between two different companies. Diskos helped Max on his feet by providing him with a custom made billing panel so that he wouldn't have to process orders manually. Shortly after
                Max began working with Diskos in order to provide more updates to the panel and increase it's functionality. 
              </p>
              <h3>
                <strong>1 Year later</strong>
              </h3>
              <p>
                After a year of working together and constantly helping each other improve their companies, Diskos and CrewCraft merged to form Galactiq. Now that we are merged our company is stronger than ever and constantly improving. 
                We hope to continue to grow and pave the way for better and cheaper services so that everyone can have a game server at an affordable price.
