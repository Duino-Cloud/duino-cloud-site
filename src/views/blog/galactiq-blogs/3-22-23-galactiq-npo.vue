                <strong>Galactiq Non Profit Organization Program</strong>
              </h2>
              <p>
                At Galactiq we love the work that NPO's (Non Profit Organizations) do. We find the mission of giving to those in need extremely important, however we also understand how difficult
                it may be to get the word out to people that you exist.

                We want to work with NPO's in order to give them some resources they may need to make their jobs easier while not eating into their costs. 
              </p>

                <strong>Requirements</strong>
              </h3>
              <p>
                You need to be a Non Profit Organization, however we may have different definitions of an NPO than you are used to.

                <strong>Supporting of Schools</strong>
              </h3>
              <p>
                It would heavily depend on the type of school, we don't have the intention of supporting public schools in the US as they already have methods of fundraising and state funding, so they
                should be able to afford everything they need already.

              <p>
                Absolutely nothing, if approved you would receive cloud storage, website hosting, domain management and email management services totally on us!
