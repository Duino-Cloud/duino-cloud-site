              <p>
                Galactiq will be releasing free Minecraft Servers!!!
              </p>
              <h3>
                <strong>Why?</strong>
              </h3>
              <p>
                We think it's important that if someone wants to start their own Minecraft server that they be able to do so with ease. However we also know that not everyone
                can afford to purchase a server and only needs one for friends. We hope to provide servers to people who just need a small servers for a couple friends without having to pay.
              </p>
            
              <h3>
                <strong>How?</strong>
              </h3>
              <p>
                Since we want to provide the best service possible to our paying customers we have certain requirements for hardware we are able to use. However since free servers are well.. free, we don't
                have these same restrictions. We'll still try to give you good performance, however it will not compare to our paid plans.
              </p>
              <h3>
                <strong>Disclaimers</strong>
              </h3>
              <p>
                We can strongly guarantee that it will not take long for the nodes running our free servers to fill up, if this happens please keep in mind that it will be awhile before
                any room is available. We do not want to invest too much money into our free servers at this time as we aren't going to see a return on it. 
              </p>
              <p>
                More Disclaimers:
              </p>
                <ol>
                <li>Servers will automatically turn off after 20-40 minutes with no players</li>
                <li>Limited Playerslots</li>
                <li>No Addon Support (Service Addons)</li>
                <li>Lower Priority Support</li>
                </ol>

              <p>
                If you would like to switch from a free server to a paid server, you can simply add the required balance of the plan you'd like to switch to and create a support request on the billing panel.
