              <p>
                At Galactiq we strive to be open and honest with our customers and community.
                So we've created a blog in order to show you what we've updated and more things coming soon.
              </p>
              <h3>
                <strong>Website Changes</strong>
              </h3>
              <p>
                Obviously we've added a blog to our website, specifically two kinds.
                The first kind is a Minecraft blog, which we'll be showing you tons of stuff you can do
                with your server. We'll also post any bugs that you guy's have brought to our attention in tickets.
                The second is a company blog, which will be telling you guys changes we've made to any of our services.
                Transparency is important in order to build trust in our community and we want to be your go to for your server needs.
              </p>
              <p>  
                Furthermore, we have been working on tidying up some issues/bugs with our site! These may not be noticable at a glance, however, they will add onto
                the user's experience, which is what we want. A few spelling mistakes were also fixed!  
              </p>  
            
              <h3>
                <strong>Location Expansion</strong>
              </h3>
              <p>
                We want nothing more than to give you low latency connections and great performance, however because of Galactiq's young age
                we can't provide this to everyone right away. Our team is working hard to expand to more regions of the world as fast as possible in order
                to give you the best gaming experience as possible. This may take some time but we will keep everyone updated as soon as we have anything new to report.
              </p>
              <p>
                One thing we have managed to do is migrate some of our servers to faster platforms, utilizing 3rd Gen Ryzenâ„¢ CPU's,
                alongside fast DDR4 memory, and lighting fast m.2 nvme drives. This will be done to all of our servers in the near future. We hope you enjoy the speed!
              </p>
              <h3>
                <strong>Games Games and More Games!</strong>
              </h3>
              <p>
                We are currently able to support a large variety of games, however we have yet to come up with pricing
                for these games and server specs. We will most likely have more games released in the future, however Galactiq's primary target is Minecraft.
                With Minecraft's ever expanding playerbase and rapidly changing playstyle, it keeps players coming back for more. Since players like to enjoy these
                new features with friends that's what we are hoping to primarily provide.
              </p>
              <h3>
                <strong>What are DEN's and DCPU's?</strong>
              </h3>
              <p>
                We've had several people ask us this question for awhile now and I think we should clarify some things.

                DCPU's are virtualized systems just for you, giving you more performance than our standard game hosting provides. The reason for this is due to the larger
                availability of resources on the system. DCPU's are split differently on systems so the load is heavily reduced.

                DEN's are similar to DCPU's except you are the ONLY person on a DEN (Unless the system offers a split version). This increases performance even more and gives
                you access to much more resources than you can get from a DCPU or standard game server. However DEN's tend to be a lot more expensive than either of the other options. 
                DEN's come with more freedom, like the ability to have more than one server on your system. If you buy a DEN then you can have as many game servers as your system can hold
                all on one system without paying extra.
