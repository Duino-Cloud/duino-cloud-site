              Diskos and CrewCraft have merged together! This merge allows us to
              continue to better our services in order to provide you the best
              experience possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              Don't expect a ton to change. We'll still be offering the same
              services, just more locations and a bigger team.
            </p>
            <h3>
              <strong>What is Diskos?</strong>
            </h3>
            <p>
              Diskos is a hosting company that started in 2017. We started
              providing hosting services because we know from experience it's
              very hard to find a reliable and affordable service provider at a
              young age. It's also hard to find a provider with a control panel
              that is easy to navigate. To fix these issues we started our own
              hosting company and created our own management panel from scratch.
              We have been providing hosting services for over 5 years now and
              have been able to provide the best hosting services to our
              customers.
            </p>
            <h3>
              <strong>What is CrewCraft?</strong>
            </h3>
            <p>
              CrewCraft is a hosting company that started in 2021. We started
              because we constantly encountered issues when trying to host our
              game servers with different hosts, so we decided that we would
              start our own company in order to tackle these issues ourselves.
            </p>
            <h3>
              <strong>Why Merge?</strong>
            </h3>
            <p>
              Diskos and CrewCraft already helped each other a ton, and we've
              tried to repay them as much as we could. Because we've worked with
              each other for more than a year, we discussed the possibility of
              working together as one entity instead as two. This allows us to
              merge all our resources together, and to continue growing and
              powering your communities.
            </p>
            <h3>
              <strong>Why the new name?</strong>
            </h3>
            <p>
              We've decided to go with a new name, because we didn't want to
              merge into the other company. So we came up with a fresh new name
              and color scheme that neither of the companies used. Although we
              have a new name we still strive to give you the best experience
              with Galactiq as your hosting provider.
            </p>
